# ** Neural Network from Scratch in C: Simulating OR Gate **
    
    #### ** Project Overview **
        ##### This project aims to design and implement a neural network from scratch in C, with a focus on simulating an OR gate.

    #### ** Motivation **
        ##### Implementing a neural network from scratch in C allows us to gain a deeper understanding of how Neural networks work. This project serves as a foundation for more complex neural network applications.

    #### ** Architecture of our Neural System **
        ##### We have input neurons which accept 2 bits from the user. Then we start our training process, at the end we have prediction from our network. Cause we don't have any hidden layers that's why output layer consists of 4 neurons instead of 2 [for classification...whether its true or false]. This might be easily fixed if we introduce hidden layers(having hidden layers can make our neural system more accurate) but that could complicate our neural network.

    #### **Future Work: **
        * For this Repo just get neural network for all Gates.
        * In future we shall do digit prediction in C [the hello world of AI]
